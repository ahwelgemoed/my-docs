## 1 Introduction 

To make sure that your app is always properly built, Mendix Studio does several consistency [checks](/studio8/checks/). When a consistency check is not met, Studio will notify you about this via the **Checks** panel. For more information on how to view the consistency errors, see the [Viewing Checks for Your App and Interacting with the Checks Panel](/studio8/checks/#viewing-checks) section in *Checks*. 

Errors need to be solved before your app can be previewed or published. An example of a consistency error is when you do not specify the entity property of a data view on a page.

Consistency errors can occur in the following editors of Mendix Studio:

* Pages (For information on consistency error in the page editor, see [Page Consistency Errors](/studio8/consistency-errors-pages/))
* Navigation document (For information on consistency error in the navigation, see [Navigation Consistency Errors](/studio8/consistency-errors-navigation/))
* Microflows (For information on consistency error in the microflow editor, see [Microflow Consistency Errors](/studio8/consistency-errors-microflows/))
