## 1 Introduction

This how-to explains how to configure a navigation bar for your app such as creating menu items and sub-items. 

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Setting a page as home page
* Create new menu bar items and sub-items

This how-to describes the following use case: 

You would like to configure a menu bar for your app. 

In Studio, the navigation bar is build in most page templates and is available on pages either as a sidebar or top bar. The configured menu bar will look the following way:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/navigation-how-to-configure/navigation-previewed.png" alt="Configured Menu" >}}

Currently you have a page called **Home_Web** that is set as the default home page and is also set for the Home menu item. Your navigation document currently looks the following way:

{{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/navigation-how-to-configure/navigation-default.png" alt="Navigation Default" >}}

You have several pages that you would like to add to the navigation:

* **Employees** – a page that lists all employees in your company and should be a default home page

* **New_Employee** – a page for creating a new employee 

* **Job_Details** – contains a list with such details as employee's position, department, income; you would like to keep this page together with other two pages listed below under one menu item called  **Employee_Details** 

* **Personal_Info** – contains a list with personal employee information, such as full name, emergency contacts, address; should be a menu sub-item of the **Employee_Details** menu item

* **Documents** – contains a list with employee files, such as employment contract, medical insurance; should be a menu sub-item of the **Employee_Details** menu item

## 2 Prerequisites

## 3 Creating Menu Items and Sub-Items

### 3.1 Setting the Employees Page as the Default Home Page {#employees-page}

Currently the **Home_web** page is set as the home page for your app. However, you would like to set the **Employees** page as the home page instead. Do the following:

1. Click the **Navigation Document** icon in the left menu bar. 

2. Open the Navigation Editor properties > **Default Home Page**.

3. Click the **Page** property to select a different page:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/navigation-how-to-configure/default-home-page.png" alt="Default Home Page" >}}

4. In the **Select Page** dialog box, choose **Employees** and click **Select**. 

5. Now you need to set the **Employees** page for the **Home** menu item otherwise it will not show in your navigation tree. Click the **Home** menu item and open its properties. 

6. Click the **Page** property:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/navigation-how-to-configure/home-menu-item.png" alt="Home Menu Item" >}}

7. In the **Select Page** dialog box, choose **Employees** and click **Select**. 

You have set the **Employees** page as the new default home page for your app.

### 3.2 Creating a Menu Item for the New Employee Page

The **New_Employee** page contains a form with the details of the new employee, this means that it contains a data view that expects an *Employee* object. Thus, when creating a menu item for it, you need to pass this object.

To create the menu item for the **New_Employee** page, do the following:

1. Click a plus at the bottom of the navigation tree to create a menu item:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/navigation-how-to-configure/adding-menu-item.png" alt="Adding Menu Item" >}}

2. Open the new menu item properties and do the following:

    1.  Set the **On Click Action** to **Page**.
        
    2. Toggle the **Create Object** option to pass the *Employee* object to the page.

    3. Click the **Entity** property to set the needed entity.

        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/navigation-how-to-configure/create-object.png" alt="Create Object" >}}

    4. In the **Select Entity** dialog box, choose **Employee** and click **Select**.

    5. Click the **Page** property.

    6. In the **Select Page** dialog box, choose **New_Employee** page and click **Select**.

    7. In the **Caption** property, delete the *Navigation item* caption and type in *New Employee*. 
    
    8. Click the **Icon** property to set the icon for the menu item.
    
    9. In the **Select icon** dialog box, search for the *plus* icon and click **Select**:
    
         {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/navigation-how-to-configure/plus-icon.png" alt="Select Plus Icon" >}}

### 3.3 Create a Menu Item for the Employee_Details Page and Configuring Its Sub-Items

You would like to place **Job_Details**, **Personal_Info**, and **Documents** pages under one menu-item named **Employee Details**, which means that they will be opened by menu sub-items. 

First, you need to create the menu item that will encompass three menu sub-items. Do the following:

1. Click a plus at the bottom of the navigation tree to create a menu item.

2. Open the new menu item properties and do the following:

    1. In the **Caption** property, delete the *Navigation item* caption and type in *Employee Details*. 
    2. Click the **Icon** property to set the icon for the menu item.
    3. In the **Select icon** dialog box, search for the *user* icon and click **Select**.

3. Click a plus *next to* the **Employee Details** menu item to create a sub-item for it:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/navigation-how-to-configure/creating-menu-sub-item.png" alt="Creating Menu Sub-Item" >}}

4. Open its properties and do the following:

    1. Set the **On Click Action** to **Page**.
    
    2. Click the **Page** property.
    
    3. In the **Select Page** dialog box, choose **Job_Details** page and click **Select**.
    
    4. In the **Caption** property, delete the *Navigation item* caption and type in *Job Details*:
    
        {{< figure src="/attachments/studio-how-to/navigation-how-to-configure/job-details-menu-item-properties.png" alt="Properties of Job Details Menu Sub-Item" >}}
    
    5. Repeat steps 1-4 to create a menu sub-item to open the **Personal_Info** page and name this sub-item *Personal Info*.  
    
    6. Repeat steps 1-4 to create a menu sub-item to open the **Documents** page and name this sub-item *Documents*. 
    
    7. The order of sub-items looks the following way now: **Documents**, **Personal Info**, **Job Details**. Drag and drop them to rearrange the order in the following way: **Job Details**, **Personal Info**, **Documents**.  

You have configured the sub-menu items for the **Employee Details** menu item.
