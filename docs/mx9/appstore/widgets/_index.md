## 1 Introduction

The widgets available in the Mendix Marketplace are single user-interface elements that can be configured, such as containers, drop-down menus, and buttons.

When you download these widgets, they will be available from the **Add widget** menu item on the [page editor](/refguide/page/) toolbar.
