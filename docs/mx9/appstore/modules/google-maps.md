## 1 Introduction

The [Google Maps](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/174/) module lets you work on latitude/longitude, among other features. The module contains a Java action that geocodes addressess with the Google geocoding service. All you need to do is connect the module to your user information entity with a reference.

Disclaimer: Before using this module, be sure to read the [Google Maps Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms), which states that the latitude/longitude coordinates retrieved with their service can only be used in combination with Google Maps, as well as the [Google Maps APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms-20180207).
