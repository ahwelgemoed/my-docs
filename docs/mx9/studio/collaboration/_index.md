## 1 Introduction 

Collaboration is an important part of Mendix Studio experience. Studio and Studio Pro users collaborate with each other a lot and need to be able to work together seamlessly. For example, a Studio Pro user who has built technical functionality might ask a Studio user to review it from the business perspective.

Or, the Studio users can ask their Studio Pro colleagues to extend the app with a more technically complex functionality. 

To provide such collaboration, the changes to your app model will be shared and synchronized automatically with team members using Mendix Studio and/or Mendix Studio Pro. This process is called collaborative development. For more information, see [Collaborative Development in Studio](/studio/collaborative-development/).

You can also collaborate with your team members while creating the app and leave comments, for example, on a specific page or a microflow, in the **Buzz** pane. For more information, see [Buzz](/studio/collaboration-buzz/).
