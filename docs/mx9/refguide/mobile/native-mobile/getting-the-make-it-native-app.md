## 1 Introduction

The Make It Native app allows developers to preview, test, and debug native mobile apps in conjunction with Mendix Studio Pro. It currently comes in two versions: 

* The **Make It Native 8 app** for Mendix Studio Pro 8 (v8.8 and above) 
* The **Make It Native 9 app** for Studio Pro v9.0 and above

Both of these apps are available for both Android and iOS devices.

For more information on using the Make It Native app to test an app, see [How To Get Started with Native Mobile](/howto/mobile/getting-started-with-native-mobile/). For advanced information on debugging with the Make It Native app, see [Debug Native Mobile Apps (Advanced)](/howto/mobile/native-debug/). If your app will require custom dependencies, such as custom widgets or fonts, see [How to Create a Custom Developer App](/howto/mobile/how-to-devapps/).

For information on which mobile operating systems are supported by the Make It Native app, see the [Mobile Operating Systems](/refguide/system-requirements/#mobileos) section of *System Requirements*.

## 2 Archives {#archives}

Occasionally Mendix will introduce features, bug fixes, and functionality that will make the Make It Native app incompatible with older versions of the Mendix Studio Pro.

For example, you might be working on a time-critical app where updating to the latest Mendix Studio Pro version might be difficult, and due to incompatible changes on the Make It Native app your latest app might not work.

To solve this issue and others like it, the apps provided in this document can be installed side by side with the latest Make It Native app. Those apps working together will allow you to continue your work unimpeded.
